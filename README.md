# Horizon-Forge-Backend üöÄ

Welcome to the **Horizon-Forge-Backend**! This is the backend API for the Horizon Forge project, providing a robust, scalable, and flexible system for managing data and handling requests from various clients. The Horizon-Forge-Backend is designed with RESTful principles and aims to be easy to integrate and extend for developers building applications on top of it. This Project is part of a big refactoring of the [Horizon Forge Web RPG](https://github.com/Lenzork/Horizon-Forge--Web-RPG)

## Overview üåê

The Horizon-Forge-Backend provides core functionality for managing resources such as users, sessions, and application-specific data. This API is built with scalability and security in mind, leveraging modern backend practices and design patterns.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.com/) (v2.0.3 or higher)
- [Mysql Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/8.4.html) (v8.0 or higher)

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lenzork/Horizon-Forge-Backend.git
   cd Horizon-Forge-Backend
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set up the necessary environment variables. See [Configuration](#configuration) for details.

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   deno .\main.ts
   ```

   The API should now be running on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The API requires a few environment variables for proper setup. Add these to your `.env` file:

```plaintext
BACKEND_PORT=8000
DATABASE_HOST="<YOUR_DATABASE_HOST>"
DATABASE_USER="<YOUR_DATABASE_USER>"
DATABASE_PASSWORD="<YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD>"
DATABASE_NAME="<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>"
DATABASE_PORT=<YOUR_DATABASE_PORT>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
```

Additional configuration options can be found in the `config` folder.
